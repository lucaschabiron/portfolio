title: How I built a tool to improve my Japanese writing
description: A small web app to practice building Japanese sentences

I’ve been studying Japanese for a while, and one thing always slowed me down: I could understand words on the page, but when I tried to actually produce Japanese, everything fell apart. Most apps are great for recognition, not expression. I needed something that forced me to build real sentences, at my level, without pressure.

So I built speakinjapanese.me — a tiny site for myself where I can practice writing Japanese in a way that actually sticks. The idea is simple: the site gives me an English sentence, I translate it, and it returns instant AI feedback with the correct version. A bit of gamification with levels and that's it.

This ended up being way more effective than I expected. It makes me think in Japanese. I’ve gotten faster at conjugations and particles feel more natural. It’s the first tool that genuinely improves my output, not just my memory.

I keep it small on purpose, but I’m planning a few features I’d love to add like difficulty levels, more grammar patterns, maybe voice input for speaking practice. My goal is to turn it into my own personal Japanese coach.

It’s not a magic solution, but it removes friction and lets me practice in 30 seconds. And honestly, that tiny habit changed the way I learn Japanese.
